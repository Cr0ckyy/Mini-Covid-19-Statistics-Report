# Mini-Covid-19-Statistics-Report

It is a simple cross-platform mobile app built with the React Native framework.

It employs React Hooks such as useState to track state in a functional component such as the data or attributes that must be followed, in this example, data connected with COVID 19.

Furthermore, the app uses useEffect to allow it to do side effects in my app components such as fetching data, directly altering the DOM and timers such as fetching data from a REST API relevant to COVID 19 instances.
